Understood that highlighted declarations were clickable
Box shown on hover was not annoying

Basic cases seemed clear and easy to read
Diagrams help in every way
Can read the text, but visualization has much quicker understanding
Difficulty with Arrays of pointers in diagrams
Found complex declarations slow (but not impossible) to read on diagram
Layout of function pointers is odd and not immediately obvious
Locks definitely made sense with constants
Would be better with a key
