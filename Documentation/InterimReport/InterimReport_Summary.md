## Project Specification
* Intended Delivery goals
	* Software
	* Simulation
	* Analytical Work
* Project Motivation

## Background
* Lays out a survey of background literature
* States for each piece how it relates to project work
* Roughly 20 references
* If all the reading hasn't been done,  simply list those still to read & understand
* **Make sure** to go depth into options with static analysis
* Could be: 
	* Analysis of competing products
	* Technical specifications of software standards
	* Necessary Software Tools
	* Background Theory
* Look at old reports
* Topic ideas include:
	* Linters
	* Reports on educational coding
	* Static analysis (esp for educational purposes)
	* UI guidelines
	* Choice of tech
		* Why vs why not for each choice
		* Elm vs FABLE-Elmish vs F#
		* C++ parser technologies

* Education - 9,47,32,28,59,29,31,16

## Implementation Plan 
* Breaks down work left to be done 
* Set of milestones
* Date for each milestone
* **Make sure** to work on significant risks going forward
	* What are the pitfalls?
	* What is the fallback
	* You **will** lose marks if you forget major ones
* Document what has already been completed

## Evaluation Plan
* How success is measured
* Tests required
* Experiements required to evaluate the product against competitors
* **User testing is important**
