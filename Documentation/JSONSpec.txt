1)  Array called decls

2)  Each object in decls MUST have a Name, and LineNumber, and a Type. Name is a
string, representing the name of the declaration. LineNumber is an int, where the
declaration is found. Type is a string, representing the type of the declaration

2)  Type can be CXType_Int, CXType_Long, CXType_Long, CXType_Float, CXType_Char_S,
CXType_ConstantArray, CXType_Pointer or CXType_Function

3)  If Type is CXType_Int, CXType_Long, CXType_Float or CXType_Char_S FINISH the
declaration

4)  If Type is CXType_ConstantArray, then the object MUST have a property
ArraySize, and a property ElementType. ArraySize is an integer, defining the size
of the array. If ArraySize is -1, the Array Size is not defined. ElementType is a string, defining what is contained in the array

5)  If Type or ArrayType is CXType_Pointer, then the object MUST have a property
PointeeType. PointeeType is an object, defining the element pointed to by the
pointer

6)  If Type is CXType_Function,

7)  PointeeType
